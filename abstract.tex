Higher educational institutions often must purchase software to manage their operations. However, the cost to purchase some  software is prohibitive, particularly for smaller institutions, resulting in software that can be difficult to use, poorly developed, or not fully-featured for the specific needs of the institution. An alternate solution is to hire a team of student developers, led by a faculty and minimal staff support, to create custom, institution-specific software that meets the college's exact needs, while providing students with valuable skill-building experience. In its sixth year of operation, our team has developed a framework to lead students who create software for an academic institution, resulting in nine software systems thus far. This case study details the student software development team framework, whose goal is to benefit students by emulating the software engineering industry. Lastly, the modifications made to continue pursuing this goal during the COVID-19 crisis is discussed.
