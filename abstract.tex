Higher educational institutions typically purchase third-party software to manage their daily operations. Because of limited budgets, the costs to purchase some needed software is prohibitive, resulting in the purchase software that can be difficult to use, poorly developed, not fully-featured for the needs of the institution, or simply the wrong tool for the job. An alternative solution is to employ a team of student developers, led by a faculty and minimal staff, support to create custom, institution-specific software that meets the college's unique needs, while providing students with valuable work and skill-building experience. In its sixth year of operation, our team has created a framework to implement software for an academic institution, developing and maintaining nine software systems thus far. This case study details the student software development team framework whose goal is to benefit students by emulating the software engineering industry. Lastly we'll describe the modifications made to continue pursuing this goal during the the COVID-19 crisis.
