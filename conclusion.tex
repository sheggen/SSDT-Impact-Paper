\section{Conclusion}
The COVID-19 crisis required many changes in our daily lives. The way we work together is no exception. Remote collaboration, particularly in the software engineering industry, is quite common and will likely be even more so following our post-COVID-19 world. Computer Science departments across the world have known remote work to be important to the industry for years now, but rarely is any effort spent in training students to be a member of a remote workforce.

The Student Software Developers Team reacted to the crisis by applying our in-person, highly collaborative, pair programming-based, Agile-based framework to a remote-only environment. In the span of one month, we were able to move our entire team to a remote-only process. The first cohort of seven students, two of which had never participated in the program before, have been able to continue the work of the team without an obvious negative impact on efficiency and code quality, and despite our distance, everyone is communicating effectively with each other. A second team of five more students, all new to the program, will launch in the weeks following this paper's submission, further testing the effectiveness of our framework in a remote environment. Finally, the students are adding an additional important skill to their blossoming resumes: remote collaboration in a software engineering team.
