\section{Introduction}

In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic \cite{covid}. Our institution made the decision to close its campus week, one of the earliest campuses to shut down due to the crisis. As academic institutions like ours moved to remote-only classes and work, their dependency on software and supporting services became more significant. This switch resulted in an influx of support requests to software companies, challenging them to keep up with this unexpected increase in usage and support needs.

Even prior to COVID-19, academic institutions are unique in their software needs, and sometimes the right tools don't exist. Adapting existing software sometimes solves parts of their needs, but is rarely a complete solution. Software modifications are supported, for a cost, by software developers through added features. Alternatively, leveraging a team of students led by faculty and staff with software engineering experience, they can craft custom, institution-specific software. The institution can avoid the high cost of software and maintenance, but still get applications that are tailored specifically to meet their needs, and support students in learning software engineering through the building of meaningful software. One of the primary benefits of a program such as this is that the students gain valuable experience, preparing them for the software engineering industry after graduation. The students learn numerous technical skills and soft skills, most of which are valuable to employers \cite{lavy2013soft}, as previous work has shown \cite{heggen2018hiring}.

There is a plethora of examples of students creating real-world software (i.e., software that is used by the product owner to do their business) in courses \cite{tadayon2004software}, capstone experiences \cite{capstone}, and internships \cite{rochesterfirstundergradsoftwareteam}. Kaminar \cite{kaminer_2014} summarizes instances where students developed software that was eventually adopted by the institution. However, these adoptions occurred organically and were typically one-off ventures with no planned support. To our knowledge, no examples were found of institutions hiring their students to develop custom software solutions, including maintaining the software throughout its use at the institution, in a multi-semester, internship model. We believe this program is the first of its kind.

This paper begins by describing one of the nine systems developed over the last six years by the Student Software Development Team (SSDT). Next, the framework for the program is described, which blends the best parts of a software engineering course, a capstone experience, and an external experience like an internship. The paper will conclude with a discussion about how the program shifted to remote-only work during the COVID-19 crisis, exemplifying the adaptability of the program and how the students are benefitting from the framework being applied to a remote-only working environment.
