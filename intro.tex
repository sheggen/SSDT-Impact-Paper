\section{Introduction}

% The growing complexity of higher education institutions means an increasing reliance on technology, in particular, software. Most institutions rely heavily on databases and management platforms, such as Banner \cite{BannerWebsite}, to manage the complexity. Similarly, learning management systems such as Moodle \cite{MoodleWebsite} and Blackboard \cite{BlackboardWebsite} improve the educational experience of students and faculty by facilitating and automating common tasks such as grading and distributing information to classes. Some of the software is open source (e.g., Moodle), which means the software itself is free, but customization, support, and maintenance can cost the institution thousands per application. According to a 2015 report about higher education spending, it is estimated that higher education institutions spend on average 4.2\% of their entire budget on information technology alone \cite{CDSBenchmarkReport}.

Though the first case of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, was traced back to November 2019 \cite{}, it was in March 2020 that the World Health Organization (WHO) officially classified the outbreak as a pandemic \cite{}. Our institution made the decision to close its campus within a week of the WHO's announcement, one of the earliest campuses to shut down due to the COVID-19 crisis. As academic institutions, like ours, moved to remote-only classes and work, their dependency on software and supporting services became more significant. This switch resulted in an influx of support requests from academic institutions, challenging software companies to keep up with these support requests and an unexpected increase in usage.

Even prior to COVID-19, every academic institution is unique in their software needs, and sometimes the tools to effectively operate don't exist. Using existing software sometimes solves parts of the institution's needs, but are missing key institution-specific features. Modifications are sometimes supported by software developers through ``additional services,'' for a cost. However, leveraging a team of students led by faculty and staff with software engineering experience, they can craft custom, institution-specific software. The institution can avoid the high cost of software and maintenance, but still get applications that are tailored specifically to meet their needs, and support students in learning software engineering through the building of meaningful software.

There are a plethora of examples of students creating real-world software (i.e., software that is eventually used by the product owner to do their business) in courses \cite{tadayon2004software}, capstone experiences \cite{capstone}, and internships outside of an academic institution \cite{rochesterfirstundergradsoftwareteam}. Kaminar \cite{kaminer_2014} summarizes a few instances where students developing software that was eventually adopted by the institution. However, these adoptions occurred organically and were typically one-off ventures. To our knowledge, no examples were found of institutions hiring their students to develop custom software solutions in a multi-semester, internship model, making this program the first of its kind. Furthermore, the students are responsible for maintaining the software throughout its use at the institution.

One of the primary benefits of a program such as this is that the students gain valuable experience, preparing them for the software engineering industry after graduation. The students learn numerous technical skills and soft skills \cite{hardskills}, most of which are deemed valuable by employers for new graduates \cite{lavy2013soft}, as previous work has shown \cite{heggen2018hiring}.

This paper begins by describing one of the nine systems developed over the last six years by the Student Software Development Team (SSDT). Next, the framework for a program is described, which blends the best parts of a software engineering course, a capstone experience, and an external experience like an internship. The paper will conclude with a discussion about how the program shifted to remote-only work during the COVID-19 crisis, exemplifying the adaptability of the program and how the students are benefitting from the framework being applied to a remote-only working environment.
